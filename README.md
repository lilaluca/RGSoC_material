# RGSoC Material

In this repo I'm storing the materials for short talks on very specific topics I've been hosting for several
[RGSoC](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) teams that have been working at our office, as well as interns who are
getting started in programming. They're introductory topics but I've tried to make them as practical as possible.

## Table of contents

1. [Ruby Objects and Classes](ruby_objects_and_classes.md)
1. [Parsing command line arguments and options](parsing_arguments_and_options.md)

Pull Requests are welcome.
