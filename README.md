# RGSoC Material

This repo contains the notes and materials for a short talk on Ruby objects and classes I made for the two [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) teams that are working at the SoundCloud office, in order to make them available for them (or anyone else that might find it useful) and also to allow them to help me improve and complete it. I intend to host more material for more talks and classes during the summer.

## Table of contents

1. [Ruby Objects and Classes](ruby_objects_and_classes.md)
1. [Parsing command line arguments and options](parsing_arguments_and_options.md)

Pull Requests are welcome.
